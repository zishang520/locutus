> All your standard libraries will be assimilated into our JavaScript collective. Resistance is futile.

Welcome to Locutus, where the boundaries of coding languages blur. We're a dedicated collective developers on a mission
to explore the possibilities of porting standard libraries from various programming language (Go, Ruby, PHP, C) to
JavaScript. Our journey is one of discovery, innovation, and sometimes, delightful chaos.

From the complex to the quirky, we assimilate libraries with a spirit of curiosity and a penchant for experimentation.
Our creations typically start as rainy Sunday afternoon puzzles, and end up ranging from groundbreaking functions that
enhance the JavaScript ecosystem, to unique oddities that challenge the norms of coding.

As we navigate through this uncharted territory, we invite you to join us. Whether to contribute, learn, or simply
marvel at the wonders of cross-language integration and portability, your presence on GitHub is valued.

Embark on this journey with us at [locutus.io](https://locutus.io/).

Use our creations at your own risk, and may they inspire you to push the boundaries of what's possible with JavaScript.

## What we are not

Even though Locutus is porting standard libraries from other languages, this is for reference only. We are **not a drop-in standard library for JavaScript**. 

If that is something you are interested in, we recommend you to take a look at [lodash](https://lodash.com/), which is more lightweight, focused and mature. It does a great job of complementing JavaScript's bare bones nature. 

That being said, there is still a fair amount of useful things to be found in this repository, and Locutus makes it easy to require and bundle just a single function that you deem worthy of your project. Our Notes should be helpful in evaluating the issues and maturity of a particular function.

## What we are not porting

As we have mentioned before, we are sticking to raw functions and steering clear of things that touch global environment, language constructs or data-types. We are not extending built-in natives either. While this would aid in assimilating a larger part of a language, past mistakes have led us to decide that these fall outside of Locutus' scope. Other projects are of course welcome to take a stab at it, leveraging our MIT licensed sources.

## A community effort

Not unlike Wikipedia, Locutus is an ongoing community effort. Our philosophy follows [The McDonald's Theory](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d). This means that we don't consider it to be a bad thing that many of our functions are first iterations, which may still have their fair share of issues. We hope that these flaws will inspire others to come up with better ideas.

So, if you know a better way to do something, we would love to see your improvements!

## Contributing

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus) for collaboration. There are a few guidelines in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It would be helpful to glance over them before submitting your work, to avoid unnecessary back and forth, as well as potential disappointment.

## Licensing

Locutus is licensed under the MIT licenses.

[The MIT license](https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus/blob/HEAD/LICENSE) allows you to use the library as you see fit (even in commercial projects) as long as you redistribute the original license along with it. You are not obligated to share your improvements, even though that would obviously be greatly appreciated and would also ensure that you won't lose your changes after you upgrade.
